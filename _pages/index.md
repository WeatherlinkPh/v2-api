The WeatherLink v2 API can be used to access weather station metadata and weather observation data for WeatherLink connected weather stations that you have access to.

Access to the API is based on an [API Key](api-key).

<div class="notice--warning">
<h4>Beta Test:</h4>
<p>The WeatherLink v2 API is currently in a beta test phase. The API currently has the following limitations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You cannot create your own v2 API Keys at this time, but API Keys are available upon request. Please submit your request through the <a href="https://gitter.im/WeatherLink/v2-api">developer support chat room</a> and be sure to include the WeatherLink account username that the API Key will belong to.</li>
  <li>
    Weather observation data is currently only supported for:
    <ul>
      <li>EnviroMonitor</li>
      <li>WeatherLink Live</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>
