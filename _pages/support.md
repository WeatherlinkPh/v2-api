# Support Chat Room

We have set up a dedicated support chat room for WeatherLink v2 API users.

The chat room is monitored by the Davis Instruments/WeatherLink engineers responsible for the v2 API. Feel free to ask your questions and report any issues you have with the v2 API.

Keep in mind other people will also be in the chat room so please be careful and do not post your API Secret in the chat.

The chat room is available at <a href="https://gitter.im/WeatherLink/v2-api">https://gitter.im/WeatherLink/v2-api</a>
