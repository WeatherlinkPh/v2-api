## Postman

Postman is a great cross platform tool for testing API calls and the installer is available at: [https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/)

We have created two files you can import into Postman that will allow you to quickly test the WeatherLink v2 API from Postman with the minimal amount of setup required.
