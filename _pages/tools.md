## Postman

Postman is a great cross platform tool for testing API calls and the installer is available at: [https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/)

We have created two files you can import into Postman that will allow you to quickly test the WeatherLink v2 API from Postman with the minimal amount of setup required.

### Step 1

Download the [WeatherLink v2 API Postman collection](/resources/WeatherLink v2 API.postman_collection.json). This file contains the information about the different API endpoints like `/stations` and `/current` and the various parameters that are required or optional.

### Step 2

Download the [WeatherLink v2 API Postman environment](/resources/WeatherLink v2 API.postman_environment.json). This file contains the information about your WeatherLink v2 API Key and Secret. This is just a blank template file that you <b><i>MUST</i></b> edit in order for everything to function properly.

After downloading the environment file open and edit it with your favorite basic text editor application.

### Step 3

Install and/or start Postman. From the menu select File > Import
